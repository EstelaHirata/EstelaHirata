Hi, I'm Estela and to talk about me it's necessary to talk about sports. 
I am passionate about judo and I carry some lessons with me: perseverance, leadership and teamwork. 
I carry with me an intrinsic desire to win and make a difference. The mat taught me that, and today I bring you a little bit of my history. 
I have a degree in Chemical Engineering from the Federal University of Paraná and an MBA in Project Management. 
I chose Chemical Engineering because – in addition to sports – I'm fond of developing processes and products aiming to increase the production scale in order to make and maintain it economically and ecologically viable. 
Furthermore, creating synergies and goals between people towards a common goal. 
I develop activities related to Lean Six Sigma, follow the operations in the thermosetting resins manufacturing units, and lead improvement projects in the manufacturing process. 
Finally, I look for new knowledge in Data Analytics.
